- 18g starter
- 65g whole wheat flour

### Yeast pre-ferment
- 100g Wheat bread flour (550)
- 1g fresh yeast

- 21g (Non-dairy) milk

- 28g soft margarine / Non-dairy butter
- 170g water
- Levain
- Pre-ferment

## Instructions
Start 17:00 on the day before baking. Make levain and yeast-preferment. Leave levain at room temperature. Give the pre-ferment 1 hour at room temeperature to start, then put in the fridge overnight.

On the next day (morning, or before noon) make the dough and let it rise for 1–2 hours until doubled in size.

Cut the dough into three equal parts and shape them into round bowls. Place all three into a baking dish / bread pan of roughly 11cm by 25cm size. Let rise again for 1–2 hours until very fluffy but not overripe. Preheat oven to 190°C.

Bake the bread until golden brown, about 30 minutes, maybe 35. Remove bread from the pan and let it cool on a rack.
