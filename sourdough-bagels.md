# Sourdough Bagels

(Roughly after [Seamus Blackley on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1371291739672125441))

## Day 1, 3 p.m.: Sourdough starter

- 275g Wholemeal wheat flour
- 275g Water (room temp)
- 25g Sourdough culture

Mix thoroughly in a bowl and leave for 18 hours at 25°C or falling from ~30° to room temperature. (I put the bowl on top of my snake terrarium which is warm until 7 p.m. then cool until 6 in the morning, then warming up again.)

## Day 2, 9 a.m.: Main dough

- 275g water (or 150g water, 125g (plant) milk for softer results)
- Old dough from last bake if any (see note below)
- Sourdough starter from above
- 650g bread flour
- 10g diastatic malt

Mix water, old dough and starter, then add flour and malt. Let sit for 30 minutes.

## 9.40 a.m.: Salt

- 15g salt

Add salt and knead until it's mixed in well. Form a ball and leave in a closed bowl for two hours at room temperature. After that the dough should have risen visibly. If not, add another half an hour.

## 11.40: Forming the Bagels

Look at Seamus' thread on how to prepare the working surface with oil and form the Bagels. __NOTE:__ Preserve the last bit of dough in a sealed box in the fridge. Add it to the dough next time.  Preheat the oven to 250°C. Leave Bagels for roughly an hour.

## 1 p.m.: Boiling and baking

Boil Bagels 30 seconds on each side in a pot with a bit of malt syrup in the water. Replace with honey, agave syrup … if you want. For the details of baking look again in Seamus' Twitter thread.
